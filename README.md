A study on the performance of GARCH and Stochastic Volatility models for Forecasting Stock Market Volatility: A Time Series Analysis


**Abstract**
This research project delves into the intricate world of financial market volatility forecasting, employing two prominent models: the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and the Stochastic Volatility (SV) model. The primary objective is to rigorously assess the effectiveness of these models in predicting stock market volatility across diverse time periods and forecasting horizons. The project meticulously follows a well-defined methodology, encompassing data collection, model implementation, ethical considerations, and extensive performance evaluations, including metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Key findings reveal the nuanced performance of the GARCH model, incorporating Maximum Likelihood techniques and a student’s t-distribution for parameter estimation, and the SV model, incorporating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and a student’s t-distribution for parameter estimation, under distinct market conditions and forecasting scenarios. The SV consistently outperforms GARCH (1,1) in next-day volatility predictions for considered stock market data, such as S&P 500 and FTSE 100 stock markets, making it an ideal choice for daily trading and short-term decision-making.
However, for longer-term forecasts often required in real-world applications, GARCH (1,1) emerges as the preferred option. It consistently exhibits superior accuracy for weekly and monthly forecasting periods, particularly during high volatility periods, underscoring the critical role of forecasting horizons in model selection.
The study concludes by offering practical recommendations for model selection, data preparation, and forecasting horizons, addressing the evolving nature of volatility forecasting. Future research directions, including hybrid models and machine learning integration, are also discussed, shedding light on the ever-evolving landscape of financial modelling and risk management.
In summary, this project contributes vital insights into the behaviour of GARCH and SV models during periods of extreme market volatility. Its findings guide practitioners and researchers in selecting the most suitable models for their specific financial applications, emphasizing the importance of considering forecast horizons, market conditions, and data characteristics in this critical decision-making process. Ultimately, it advances the field of volatility forecasting, aiding investors, and decision-makers in navigating the complexities of financial markets.
